# Northwind Traders Tableau Story

## Background 
Northwind Traders is a fictional company introduced by Microsoft as part of their sample database series called Northwind and Pubs. The database simulates a company that imports and exports gourmet food products to various customers around the world. It contains information on customers, suppliers, products, orders, and other related information that is typical of a real-world business. 

The dashboard  provides insights into the company's performance in key areas, including sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs. The dashboard is built with a capability of accomodating additional inputs in future to analyze  recommendations. 

Orders span from 2013 to 2015 across customers from various countries around the world. Product costs, revenue and shipping charges are consolidated to derive metrics and drive business decisions for future investments and expansion.
